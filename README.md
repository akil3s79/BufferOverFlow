# BufferOverFlow
**With this script you can perform the first connection step (fuzzing) against a server to successfully exploit a Buffer OverFlow. Is written in Python3**

# In fuzzer.py:
You only need python 3 on your machine and correctly configure the IP address and the port (look for the fields called change me).

# In fuzzer.py:
You only need python 2.7 on your machine and correctly configure the IP address and the port and create a pattern with the necessary characters. In this case it is 100, but you must modify it with the value you need (look for the fields called change me).

# The way to execute this scripts is simple:

python3 fuzzer.py 
or 
python3 fuzzer.py
